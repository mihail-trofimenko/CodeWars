Your task is to return the amount of white rectangles in a NxN spiral. 
Your font may differ, if we talk of white rectangles, we talk about the symboles in the top row.

Notes:
As a general rule, the white snake cannot touch itself.
The size will be at least 5.
The test cases get very large, it is not feasible to calculate the solution with a loop.
Examples
For example, a spiral with size 5 should look like this:

⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

And return the value 17 because the total amount of white rectangles is 17.

да ну нахер
